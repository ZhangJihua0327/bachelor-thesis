abstract = {Inductive invariants can be robustly synthesized using a learning model where the teacher is a program verifier who instructs the learner through concrete program configurations, classified as positive, negative, and implications. We propose the first learning algorithms in this model with implication counter-examples that are based on machine learning techniques. In particular, we extend classical decision-tree learning algorithms in machine learning to handle implication samples, building new scalable ways to construct small decision trees using statistical measures. We also develop a decision-tree learning algorithm in this model that is guaranteed to converge to the right concept (invariant) if one exists. We implement the learners and an appropriate teacher, and show that the resulting invariant synthesis is efficient and convergent for a large suite of programs.},

    abstract  = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) simplifies hardware-centric network architecture by employing forwarding devices (switches), SDN controller, and SDN applications. Depending on the SDN application that manages the controller, controller can turn a switch to act as a switch, router, firewall, etc. SDN also enables switch to access more network information through controller. Our proposed SDN application consists of traffic monitoring module and routing module to optimize the network. Traffic monitoring module will monitor switches' port utilization and routing module uses deep reinforcement learning agent trained with deep deterministic policy gradient to manage switch forwarding. Relevant flow entries are issued to OpenFlow switches to manage switch forwarding. Agent changes the routing according to the switches' port utilization and learn the best routing to minimize packet loss. The proposed method will be implemented and evaluated in the future work using Mininet to emulate data layer (hosts, switches) and open source SDN controller Ryu.},

We describe some novel induction-based methods, and show how they are related to more standard fixpoint algorithms for invariance checking. We also present preliminary experimental results in the verification of FPGA cores. This demonstrates the practicality of combining a SAT-solver with induction for safety property checking of hardware in a real design flow.},
